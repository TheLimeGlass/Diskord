# Diskord
A Skript addon for full Discord4J support.

## Building
Open a command prompt

The following will clone Diskord to your current directory location. To change the current directory as to where you want it cloned, type `cd PATH` replace PATH with the directory path location.

Then type the clone command
`git clone https://github.com/TheLimeGlass/Diskord.git`

Now to build Diskord you simply need to run the `gradle` command. You can find the compiled JAR file in `./build/libs` of the Diskord gradle folder when complete.

__Note:__ If you do not have [Gradle] installed then use ./gradlew for Unix systems or Git Bash and gradlew.bat for Windows systems in place of any gradle command.
